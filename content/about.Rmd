The purpose of this website is to document all instructions, slides and exercises of the R-tistic classes.

The website was built with the [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package. The theme was forked from [jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme](https://github.com/jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme) and modified by [Yihui Xie](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium-theme).
