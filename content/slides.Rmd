## Eawag

R classes were given in Duebendorf at the research institute Eawag. During my last year of working at Eawag, I had the great opportunity to attend R classes offered by the University of Zurich and developed a passion that I am excited to share with my former colleagues.

### Preparation slides

These slides were prepared in preparation of the first R-tistic class at Eawag in Duebendorf, Switzerland. An HTML version is accessible [here](http://bit.ly/2nnt9cw).
